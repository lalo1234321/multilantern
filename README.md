**In this project I used the microcontroller atmega328P mounted on the arduino board**

Materials:

1.- 4 leds

2.- 1 Push button(4 pins)

3.- protobard

The program works like this:

if you push one time the button the  first led will turn on

the second time the second led will turn on as well

the third is like the others but with a third led
the fourth will turn on a intermittent led with a pause of 5 seconds
the fifth turn off every led on the board
