**In this project I used the microcontroller atmega328P mounted on the arduino board**

Materials:\n
1.- 4 leds\n
2.- 1 Push button(4 pins)\n
3.- protobard\n

The program works like this:\n
if you push one time the button the  first led will turn on\n
the second time the second led will turn on as well\n
the third is like the others but with a third led\n
the fourth will turn on a intermittent led with a pause of 5 seconds\n
the fifth turn off every led on the board\n
